# KeyboardKit change log

- 2020-04-04
    - Changes Page Up and Page Down to semantic directions so they will scroll horizontally in a scroll view that can only scroll horizontally.
    - Fixes keyboard scrolling resulting in an incorrect scroll position when content size is smaller than the bounds (seen as unwanted scrolling in the non-scrolling direction).
